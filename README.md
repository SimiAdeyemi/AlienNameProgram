# AlienNameProgram

I automated the generation of character (alien) names by using actorsâ€™ real names and manipulating them to produce alien-sounding character names. 
 
Taking each actor name in the form: 
    given_name  family_name 
 
to produce the following output after successful processing: 
e.g. 
 
Actor name:   john smith 
Alien character:    smijo 
 
 
Actor name:   haoting wang 
Alien character:  wanha  
etc
